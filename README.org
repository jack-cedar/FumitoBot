* Fumito ( 文斗 ) Bot
A Discord bot written in the F# programming language

** The Name ( 文斗 )
The name means somthing along the lines of "Guiding Scholar"
but the choice of the name goes a bit deeper then that
the name was picked because i liked the meanings of the individual kanji
 * 文 (fumi) represents "writing" or "literature".
   it signifies knowledge and culture as well as intellectual pursuits,
   but it can also convey a sense of elegance and sophistication
   which i think fits perfectly with F# and functional programming

 * 斗 (to) signifies the "Big Dipper" constellation,
   its commonly used in Japanese names and is associated with guidance and leadership
   i.e. someone who shines brightly and leads others.
   this fits along the lines of a discord bot which purpose is to assist user
